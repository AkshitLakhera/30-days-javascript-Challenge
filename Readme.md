# 30 Days of JavaScript - My Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I will be pushing my solutions for the "30 Days of JavaScript" challenge by Hitesh Choudhary. In this journey, I'll be tackling various JavaScript exercises and projects, implementing them in my own unique way.

## About the Challenge

The "30 Days of JavaScript" challenge is designed to help you improve your JavaScript skills through daily practice. Each day presents a new task, problem, or project that covers different aspects of JavaScript, from basics to more advanced topics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each day of the challenge. Each folder contains:

- A image of task

Here's how the repository is structured:
